This repository contains Digital Signal Processing (DSP) laboratory programs implemented as part of the academic curriculum. The lab experiments focus on understanding fundamental DSP concepts through practical implementation and analysis of discrete-time signals and systems.

📌 Objectives

1.To analyze and process discrete-time signals

2.To understand the behavior of DSP algorithms through simulation

3.To implement signal processing techniques using software tools
